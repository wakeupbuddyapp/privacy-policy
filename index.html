															<div><br></div>
															<div><em><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></em></div>

																	<div><br></div>
																	<div>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</div>

																		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br><br></li>
																		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br><br></li>
																		<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br><br></li>
																		<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br><br></li>
																		<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br><br></li>
																		<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br><br></li>

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
