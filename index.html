															<div><br></div>
															<div><em><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></em></div>
															<div><br></div>

You can <a href="https://wakeupbuddyapp.github.io/privacy-policy/#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.</div>
																	<div><br></div>
																	<div>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</div>
																	<ul>

																		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br><br></li>
																		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br><br></li>
																		<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br><br></li>
																		<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br><br></li>
																		<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br><br></li>
																		<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br><br></li>

																					<div><br></div>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
